<b>Pashu-Seva is at the core of Niswarth, working towards all animals around.</b>
The first animal shelter of Niswarth was founded in Jaipur at the start of 2021. The thought of serving and saving the animals around us has driven David from feeding the stray animals to setting up the Niswarth Animal shelter. 
The shelter accepts voluntary work and donations from individuals willing to serve. You can also adopt furry friends from Niswarth. Providing food and a home to loving animals is selfless service.

<b>Rays of Hope</b>
<ul>
    <li>Be the Aasha ki Kiran for the animals around you</li>
    <li>Kindness and passion drive you to a cause of welfare.</li>
    <li>Be a part of Niswarth today through volunteering or donations.</li>
</ul>
